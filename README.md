# Where's Perry?
## Unity 2D platformer puzzle game

For finalising my batchelor studies I created a 2D platformer game in Unity starring Perry the Platypus from the cartoon called Phineas and Ferb. Main gameplay includes switching between 2 characters (one terrestrial and one flying) in order to solve a puzzle to create an escape path out of the current level. It includes 6 levels with different difficulties composed of interactive elements such as moving platforms, timed buttons, levers, trapdoors, rolling stones, boxes lasers and enemies.
